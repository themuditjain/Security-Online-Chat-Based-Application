# Project Idea
## Basic Idea is to develop an online messaging website.
Key features of the web site will be :
- Instant messsaging
- Group chatting
- Instant File sharing
- Profile creation for every user.

### How it is different from other messaging  website :
- Instead of sharing message directly as text, we are going to use Markdown files. This will give user much better experience in sharing informations to the other users.
- User Is able to send these types of messages :
   - Markdown File
   - Direct image
   - Direct video

- There will be seperate tabs for the single message sharing users and group messaging. This will help the user to handle the user's messaging contacts.
- If time permits we will also include forwarding message feature, key bindings, and some more details that I will explain later on.
- We will also add security features like message encryption in our project.
### Project plan 
- We will divide the whole team into following different roles :
  - Developers
  - Testers
  - Documentation and Model designer
  - Security analysts

Member can have more than one role
